- **Location-Specific Strategies:**
  - **Store Performance:** Develop tailored strategies for each store based on their unique sales performance. For instance, invest in improving coffee and tea offerings in Astoria and enhance bakery promotions in Lower Manhattan.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:**
  - **Continual Analysis:** Regularly update the dashboard with new data to track performance trends and adjust strategies accordingly. Utilize insights from heat maps and decomposition trees to drive continuous improvements.
- **Customer Insights:**
  - **Feedback Collection:** Implement mechanisms to gather customer feedback to better understand preferences and improve product offerings based on real-time customer data.
